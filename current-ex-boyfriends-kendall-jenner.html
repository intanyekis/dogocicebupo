The genesis of Kendall and Hadid’s relationship was in October 2016 when the former called dibs on the latter in an Instagram post.</p><p>As she was friends with his older sisters, this was thought to be a joke but in 2018, they were caught making out on several occasions: first at the after-party of the CFDA Fashion Awards and then at the after-party of New York Fashion Week in September.</p><p>They became inseparable the following month but November came and it circulated that they were heading for a breakup as <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Kendall was seen with an ex, Ben Simmons</a>.

It is believed that it was the model that came between Tinashe and Ben: <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>the singer confirmed this in a July 2018 tweet</a>. So, the Kendall-Ben relationship began on a controversial note.</p><p>While the NBA player was with Tinashe, it started circulating that a romance was brewing between him and Kendall. This was after the two were spotted in public several times, beginning from May 2018. They were seen shopping, on a lunch date, and what have you.</p><p>By July when they were spotted cuddling, it became apparent they were dating. The NBA star and the model continued serving relationship goals and at some point, it was reported that they were roommates in a $25,000-a-month rental house.</p><p>Theirs’ was an on-and-off relationship that went on until February 2020 when they attended Super Bowl LIV at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. But then, it was said that they had parted for good since May 2019; that whatever happened after then was a “casual friendship”.</p><h3><strong>Blake Griffin</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name: </strong>Blake Austin Griffin</li><li><strong>Date of Birth: </strong>March 16, 1989</li><li><strong>Age:&nbsp;</strong>34 Years Old</li><li><strong>Occupation:&nbsp;</strong>Professional Basketball Player</li><li><strong>Duration of Relationship:&nbsp;</strong>August 2017 – April 2018</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/kendall-jenner-blake-griffin-ftr.jpg><p>Blake Griffin is another professional athlete that features in the dating timeline of Kendall Jenner.

While he has never been married, he has two kids with Brynn to whom he was engaged.</p><p>It was the same year that Blake’s relationship with Brynn came to an end that he began dating Kendall. Their relationship started in August 2017 when Blake who was playing for the Los Angeles Clippers and Kendall Jenner were first spotted together at a Kendrick Lamar concert at the Staples Center.</p><p>They were also seen together later that day at a Travis Scott after party. For a while, it was difficult to tell how serious they were. As time went by, it emerged that things had picked up between the two.

Apart from the “Rude Boy” singer, the rapper has dated other popular women like Teyana Taylor, Iggy Azalea, Chanel Iman, and Tahiry Jose.</p><p>ASPA Rocky has also been romantically linked to Rosee Divine, Rita Ora, and Madison Skylar. One of the most interesting facts about his relationship with Kendall is the fact that he was also linked to Kendall’s younger sister, Kylie Jenner, about a year before it emerged that he and Kendall were lovers.</p><p>People began paying attention to the two in May 2016 after they were seen spending time together on several occasions. By June, they were seen together in Paris and it became apparent they had something special. Although neither of them commented on what was happening between them, there was no doubt they were in a relationship as time made that obvious.</p><p>They attended multiple showbiz events together, including the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Met Gala of May 2017</a> that had them all over each other. It was said that the relationship had become serious at this point and that the two were happy with the way things were going for them.</p><p>But then a few months later, in August 2017, it circulated that they called time on their relationship because of their tight schedules.</p><h3><strong>Jordan Clarkson (Rumored)</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name: </strong>Jordan Taylor Clarkson</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> June 7, 1992</li><li><strong>Age:&nbsp;</strong>31 Years Old</li><li><strong>Occupation:&nbsp;</strong>Professional Basketball Player</li><li><strong>Duration of Relationship:&nbsp;</strong>March 2016 – January 2017</li></ul><p>A Filipino-American professional basketball player, Jordan is one of the several NBA stars believed to have dated Kendall Jenner.

All through his career, he has had a busy love life which has seen celebrity gossip outlets link him to Bella Hadid, Chantel Jeffries, Chanel Iman, Hailey Bieber, Ashlee Roberson, and Karizma Ramir.</p><p>Based on what was reported in some quarters, the basketball player and Kendall Jenner had been secretly dating for months before the night they were spotted together at The Nice Guy, an intimate restaurant and lounge in West Hollywood: this was in March 2016.</p><p>Kendall and Jordan Clarkson were seen hanging out together a number of times but neither of them ever confirmed they were dating. When the basketball player was asked about what was happening between him and the model, he evaded offering a straight answer to the question.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Jordan said he prefers keeping his private life private</a> and that even if something was happening between them, no one would know. Similarly, Kendall dismissed claims about dating the NBA star. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>In a July 2019 tweet</a>, she pointed out that she had only dated two out of the multiple NBA players she has been linked to.

The NBA star got engaged to Haylee Harrison whom he has been dating since the summer of 2019 in November 2020.</p><p>Before Haylee, he dated Cassie Amato, Tomi Garrn, Christina Perri, and Robyn Crowley. It was sometime in 2014 that the basketball player was first linked to the famous model. From what we gathered, they met through a personal trainer they shared. They began hanging out thereafter and as expected, people began speculating they were dating.</p><p>The rumors had a natural death after people stopped seeing them together in public. However, it came back to life in January 2017 when they were seen together at a Bentley dealership in Beverly Hills.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>TMZ reported that they partied all over Hollywood</a> a few days after the Bentley dealership. This fueled the speculations about them being lovers but neither of the two ever confirmed or denied they were dating. But based on Kendall’s tweet about dating only two NBA stars, it is safe to conclude that what happened between her and the basketball player was a platonic affair.</p><h3><strong>Nick Jonas (Rumored)</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name: </strong>Nicholas Jerry Jonas</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> September 16, 1992</li><li><strong>Age:&nbsp;</strong>31 Years Old</li><li><strong>Occupation:&nbsp;</strong>Singer-Songwriter and Actor</li><li><strong>Duration of Relationship:&nbsp;</strong>August 2015 – August 2015</li></ul><p>Nick Jonas is one of Hollywood’s most accomplished entertainers.

It was sometime in August 2015 that it began circulating that the singer and the model were lovers.</p><p>Celebrity gossip platforms reported that the two were encouraged to pursue a relationship by Gigi Hadid who was dating Nick’s brother, Joe Jonas. It was claimed that Gigi played cupid because she wanted to have more of her friend (Kendall) around.</p><p>Many bought the story as Kendall and Jonas had been seen together a couple of times.

It was even claimed in some quarters that sources close to them divulged that Kendall’s mother wanted her to date the British racing driver.</p><p>As typical of Kendall, she refrained from discussing the topic; so the rumors went on until Lewis dismissed the speculations. He reportedly stated that they were just friends.</p><p>The Formula One racer has been quiet about his love life of late, but it is no secret he had an on-and-off relationship with Nicole Scherzinger, an American singer-songwriter, from 2007 to 2015.
