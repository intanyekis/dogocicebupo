But just because they are rich and famous doesn’t mean they are immune to making a bad decision with a tattoo. We have seen our fair share of tattoos in Hollywood and there are usually pretty good stories behind them. Sometimes we find inspiration when it comes to our favorite celebrities and their tattoos while other times we cringe and wonder what they were thinking.</p><p>Some celebrities get tattoos because they have a deep personal meaning to them while other celebrities get them because they partied too hard one night and made a mistake. Celebrities certainly are no exception when it comes to making mistake in their lives and that includes getting a bad tattoo. We have tattoos from Kendall Jenner, Kesha, and Steve-O. We’re not really surprised that Steve-O got a bad tattoo, his whole life consists of bad ideas. But they sure made him famous, and that’s all that matters to him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whether you love them or hate them, tattoos are permanent and it’s so important to be careful when it comes to choosing a tattoo that you are still going to love when you are old and grey. Celebrities have also made the dreaded mistake of getting a tattoo to represent their love only to have to cover it up later. When will people learn? Check out these 25 questionable celeb tattoos we would never copy.</p><h2 id=steve-o-tattooed-his-own-face-on-his-body><strong>Steve-O Tattooed His Own Face on His Body</strong></h2><p>We honestly have to wonder what he was thinking. Could you be any more in love with yourself? It was a bizarre move on his part when he tattooed a rather large image of his own face on his back. We’re not sure if he was drunk or high when he did it, but it’s an awful tattoo. It’s not his first terrible tattoo and it will likely not be his last. At the bottom of the tattoo, he has his signature tattooed with the words, “Yeah dude, I rock.” He has made a lot of bad choices in his life because he was drinking and this could likely be one of them. Since he’s been sober, he said he has found clarity in his life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“The first thought that I had about really trying to get sober was, 'Man, I could do a lot of good in the world. I can lead by example and just be this heroic recovery guy.'</strong></p><p>And that's just a bad reason to get sober. You can't get sober for anybody's benefit, let alone the world at large. You really got to do it for yourself.”</p><h2 id=johnny-depp-s-impulsive-tattoo><strong>Johnny Depp’s&nbsp;Impulsive&nbsp;Tattoo</strong></h2><p>There was a time when Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder were considered to be soulmates or at least they thought so at the time. Winona actually defended Depp when the scandal between him and Wynona came out. “I can only speak from my own experience, which was wildly different than what is being said,” Ryder told Time. “He was never, never that way toward me. Never abusive at all toward me.</p><p><strong>I only know him as a really good, loving, caring guy who is very, very protective of the people that he loves.”</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Depp’s love for Ryder was so strong that he got her name tattooed on his body. The tattoo used to read “Winona Forever” which we now know is just not the case. This is always a bad idea because there are no guarantees in life and when a breakup happens you are stuck with a name on your body for your next girlfriend to glare at. Depp decided to get it fixed so that it said, “Wino Forever” which is certainly not any better than just keeping her name there. It’s a small enough tattoo on his arm that he really could have got it covered up completely with something else, so we’re not sure why he just had the words changed.</p><h2 id=miley-cyrus-vegan-tattoo><strong>Miley Cyrus Vegan Tattoo</strong></h2><p>It is a weird thing to shout out your healthy lifestyle by tattooing your arm. Thank goodness, she didn’t go out and get one of those tattoos that just say “Vegan,” but hers isn’t much better. She tattooed a little plant or flower on the inside of her arm to represent her choice to be a vegan. Why that would be something to permanently put on your body, we’re not sure. We don’t see too many tattoos out there of bacon or steaks. She posted a picture of the tattoo on Instagram with the caption, "Vegan for life!" Cyrus posts a lot on her Instagram page about her vegan lifestyle and has stated,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“If you choose to eat meat, you love pets not animals.”</strong></p><p>Which means that Peta is basically in love with her right now. Her fiancé Liam Hemsworth is right on board with her and Cyrus stated that "By not consuming animal products over the years I have protected myself from preventable diseases and saved the valuable lives of animals that would be turned into breakfast/lunch/dinner.” She definitely has strong views about the whole subject and she’s not alone in Hollywood.</p><h2 id=mike-tyson-s-face-tattoo><strong>Mike Tyson’s Face Tattoo</strong></h2><p>The face should be totally off limits in our opinion when it comes to getting a tattoo. Mike Tyson didn’t get the memo however when he got a tattoo design around his eye. As if Tyson didn’t look intimidating enough already, but he made himself look even more of a scary dude with this tattoo. In the movie Hangover 2, they poked fun at the tattoo when one of the friends got the exact same tattoo done while on vacation during a blackout moment. These are likely the kind of tattoos that you are sure to regret over time. When asked by an interviewer for Sports Illustrated as to whether he regretted the tattoo Tyson said,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“No, a lot of stuff happened out of this tattoo, a lot of good stuff. Other young athletes come to me and said, ‘It’s because of you they call it the Mike Tyson. People have to register their tattoos. You have to have the likeness of your tattoo.”</strong></p><p>He got the tribal tattoo in 2003 and said that he had originally told the artist to tattoo hearts all around his eye so that he could be seen as “The Man of Hearts.” It’s a good thing that tattoo artist talked him out of it because that probably would have been a huge regret.</p><h2 id=audrina-patridge-s-unusual-fruit-tattoo><strong>Audrina Patridge’s Unusual Fruit Tattoo</strong></h2><p>When&nbsp;The&nbsp;Hills star showed up to the red carpet with this colorful tattoo on the back of her neck, many people were trying to figure out what the unusual fruit was. Does she even know? It looks like a combination of a heart and a fruit with a snake wrapped around it. It’s certainly not one of the best tattoos we’ve seen in Hollywood. It’s very reminiscent of the whole apple and snake from Adam and Eve and Patridge confirmed that idea.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“My tattoo is a heart with four chambers that turns into an apple with a snake around it, it symbolizes the story of Adam and Eve, and also temptation and destiny,”</strong></p><p>said Audrina. Patridge filed for divorce last year and had been going through a difficult time. "Light of my life. This little beauty lights up the room wherever she is," Patridge began, adding, "I appreciate all your thoughts and messages, this is a difficult time but we are doing okay. (Kirra loves this little dress my grandma made it for my aunt 50+ years ago and it's still in perfect condition and cute as ever)." The relationship clearly wasn’t a good one because she had to file for a restraining order as well.</p><h2 id=angelina-jolie-s-billy-bob-tattoo><strong>Angelina Jolie’s Billy Bob Tattoo</strong></h2><p>There was a time when Angelina Jolie was so smitten with the raggedy Billy Bob Thornton that she wore a vial of his blood around her neck and of course tattooed his name to her arm. Seriously, tattooing names are always a bad idea unless it’s your children. Jolie is notorious for tattooing her current relationship on her body. Billy Bob isn’t even the last guy that she did it with. Jolie has a ton of tattoos all over her body, but there were times that she had to get some removed. That was certainly the case when it came to Billy Bob’s tattoo. The name and the dragon were both removed from her arm. Getting tattoos removed is not an easy process and it can be painful. She talked about the tattoo removal process in an interview.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"I'll never be stupid enough to have a man's name tattooed on me again."</strong></p><p>Never say never, Angie. The process took five visits to have the tattoo removed and it’s not even the first one. She has also covered up a lot of her tattoos, so it’s clear that she really doesn’t know what she wants at the time she gets them done.</p><h2 id=kesha-s-tattoo-is-misunderstood><strong>Kesha's tattoo is misunderstood&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Kesha is full of tattoos, and while this eye one is a little creepy, she is another celebrity who tattooed the inside of her mouth. She wanted to send a message out to the world when she did it and had the words, “suck it” tattooed. She said that she'd gotten a lot of perverted remarks about the tattoo and we can’t say that we're that surprised. People can be immature. During an interview with Kiss FM in London, she talked about the tattoo. “The mouth tattoo, although you’re being a pervert, and I know exactly what you’re thinking, was purely because I was thinking about people that, hater’s gonna hate, you know what I mean? So they can all just suck it.” She also mentioned that while she was getting the tattoo completed, she was “drooling blood. It was gross.” Yeah, no kidding. If you want to see the gross procedure of Kesha getting the tattoo done, you can find it on YouTube. We really think that this was a tattoo she should have passed on. She’s definitely dealt with a lot in her life and it’s not just haters. She had battled eating disorders and depression throughout her life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=adriana-lima-s-uninspiring-tattoo><strong>Adriana Lima’s Uninspiring Tattoo</strong></h2><p>Considering that Adriana Lima is a famous supermodel, she has terrible taste in tattoos. Out of all the things that she could have chosen, she tattooed a very generic design on her ankle. It’s tacky and something we don’t really expect to see these days. Tattoo artistry has grown to a whole new level where tattoos can look like actual pieces of art. But maybe she got it done when she was a young girl. There is surprisingly a meaning behind the tattoo and one that she is keeping to herself.</p><p><strong>“I got it when I was 19 years old in Tahiti while traveling for a shoot. I asked my mom for permission and she said yes, but one only. I cannot tell you the meaning because it is something very personal, but it does have something to do with protection.”</strong></p><p>Lima’s has stated that she wants to model long into her 40s. “I am 35 years old and representing a mature woman. I really appreciate how we [women] can age so gracefully and not be afraid of [aging]. So I'm not only representing Brazilian women but women from all over the world, who are not afraid to age and embrace themselves.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=avril-lavigne-s-simple-star><strong>Avril Lavigne's Simple Star</strong></h2><p>Sorry, but we had to say it. Sometimes when we look at the tattoos that people choose to put on their bodies, we think to ourselves, why did you even bother? This is exactly the thought process that comes to mind when we look at Avril Lavigne’s scratchy star. In 2008, she had seven tattoos, she likely has more now. Just Jared interviewed Lavigne after a concert and he asked her if she planned on covering her body with tattoos.</p><p><strong>“All of my tattoos are super dainty and in little spots. I haven’t done the big tattoo yet.”</strong></p><p>She was another celebrity that got matching ink with a significant other. She and husband Chad Kroeger got matching tattoos when they were together. The two have split since 2015 and who knows what they did with their matching tattoos. Avril has had a rough past couple of years and she was seen on the red carpet for the first time in two years when she made an appearance 25th annual Race To Erase MS Gala at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. She stated that she is releasing a new record and planning on making a comeback.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kendall-jenner-s-meow-tattoo><strong>Kendall Jenner’s Meow Tattoo</strong></h2><p>We’ve seen Kendall Jenner showing off her tattoo a few times. If you haven’t seen it, it’s just the word “meow” on the inside of her life. We’re not sure why anyone would want a tattoo inside their mouth, not to mention the fact that it must be a painful place to get one done. Jenner was on The Ellen DeGeneres Show where she was asked to show off her tattoo. “I'll try and show you without messing up my lipstick... I was not thinking…” We doubt that the tattoo earned her any more respect in the industry. As for, "Why meow? And why there?" Jenner said, "It was literally the first thing that came into my mind." So, now we know that there isn’t a whole lot going on in her head when she's under influence. She has stated that it was one of the tattoos that she regrets the most. She also told Ellen that it would have been a great place to put her boyfriend’s name which we think would have been a terrible idea. “In my face! (Meow) was literally the first thing that came to my mind. I feel like it would have been a good place to put a boyfriend's name. It's just fattiness or is it muscle... bone hurts really bad.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=angelina-s-spiritual-bonding-with-brad><strong>Angelina’s Spiritual Bonding With Brad</strong></h2><p>This is a massive tattoo and one that she likely regrets now because this one won’t be easy to get rid of. Obviously, she got it before she split with Brad and it was supposed to spiritually bind her to him. Clearly, it didn’t work very well because he ran away anyway. She’s already removed Billy Bob’s tattoo and now she’s going to have to remove this one. Can you imagine a future lover seeing her spiritual bond with Brad on her back? It’s just not cool. Billy Bob Thornton was kind enough to chime in his opinion to TMZ about her tattoo. He’s aware that she did something to his design. Thornton stated that "she can always rework them.” That’s certainly helpful advice. She had the tattoo applied with an ancient handheld Thai method. They use a surgical steel needle instead of a tattoo gun which can be a lot more painful.</p><p><strong>“I look in the mirror and I see that I look like my mother, and that warms me,"</strong></p><p>she told an interviewer. 'I also see myself aging, and I love it because it means I'm alive — I'm living and getting older.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=eve-s-paw-prints><strong>Eve’s Paw Prints&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Sadly, Eve has one of the tackiest tattoos in Hollywood. Women have to be careful putting a tattoo on their chest because unless it’s super awesome, it can appear tacky. The bottom line here is that her tattoo is not great. The paw prints are part of her signature look, so we know why she got it, but she probably regrets it on some level. It’s not the only tattoo that she has and she has admitted that she has regretted certain tattoos. She’s had a former boyfriend’s name tattooed on her body.</p><p><strong>“You can’t regret decisions you make. You were in a certain place at a certain time and it’s okay, it was meant for you at that moment, and it tells the story of you.”</strong></p><p>Well, we have to admit that she has a pretty good attitude about it. She has said that all her tattoos have meaning even the ones that have been covered up. “They all still have meaning&nbsp;— even when I’ve had to cover one up. I’ve only had to do that twice. But they each tell a story. I’ve gotten my tattoos in different countries that I love&nbsp;— so it’s like a map&nbsp;— a scrapbook.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=miley-cyrus-is-a-double-offender><strong>Miley Cyrus Is A Double Offender</strong></h2><p>She must really love Liam Hemsworth in order to tattoo a container of his favorite food on her body. What was she thinking? We love Hellmann’s mayonnaise made with real olive oil, but we’re not about to tattoo the container on our body. We definitely feel like this should have been a moment where Liam said, “Baby, no.” Los Angeles ink god, Dr. Woo was the one that imprinted that little jar of Vegemite on her arm. If you are wondering what it is, it’s a brown paste that can be put on toast, pastries or sandwiches. It’s made from leftover brewers’ yeast extract and contains spice additives and vegetables. Again, we’re not sure why she would ever get something that bizarre permanently tattooed to her body. Hemsworth stated that he went the vegan way because he could no longer support an industry that killed animals.</p><p><strong>"Ethically, I didn’t feel good about supporting those industries," he said. "It’s not good for the environment, it’s not good for people and certainly not for animals."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A lot of the things that Miley Cyrus has done over the years has been because she was looking for attention or because she goes around doing what she wants.&nbsp;She tries to stay true to herself.</p><h2 id=mena-suvari-went-for-words-of-inspiration><strong>Mena Suvari Went For&nbsp;words of inspiration</strong></h2><p>Mena Suvari has a pretty cool neck tattoo of a lion, so we’re not sure why she ruined the vibe of that style with a bunch of words that don’t really make any sense. It’s just one of those cliché statements like “Live Laugh Love.” It’s just a terrible thing to put on your back especially in that size. It totally takes away from the beautiful lion tattoo that she does have. Trend Prive magazine asked the actress what the best and worst part of her career has been. “The best phase? Oh, I don’t know, it’s never black and white to me, it’s always a journey, you know?</p><p><strong>It’s how life is. It’s always cyclical, there are so many kinds of ups and downs. Being a part of so many different and sometimes pivotal moves in my life, just gave me the sense of learning how to roll with whatever kinda came my way I think, but I don’t really look at my life like this was the best part, and this was the worst part.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>I think it’s just always been up and down. I’m enjoying the ride, as they say.”</p><h2 id=justin-bieber-wants-to-do-better><strong>Justin Bieber Wants To Do Better</strong></h2><p>There are many ways you can represent your ability to continuing to better yourself. This tattoo of Bieber’s is a little ridiculous if you ask us. His leg tattoo says, “Better At 70.” A lot of people would be confused about a tattoo like that since Bieber is clearly nowhere near his 70s. He explained the meaning by the tattoo when he captioned this photo on Instagram.</p><p><strong>"I look back at a lot of things in my life, mistakes, insecurities, and although I have felt I've wasted a lot of time it also makes me want to be better faster! For me personally, I want to work every day to be better at 70,"</strong></p><p>he wrote. That’s a pretty great way to look at things, but we just think it’s a very weird tattoo. He does have a lot of tattoos on his body including one that his whole family got. "It's based on this book that my whole family read," he revealed. "Everyone's got it on their wrist and it was right before I really had any tattoos and so I wanted to make sure it wasn't visible and so I got it down here. Basically, it was about this seagull who wanted to be more than just a seagull."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=aaron-carter-s-neck-tattoo><strong>Aaron Carter’s Neck Tattoo</strong></h2><p>When it comes to the neck and the face, it’s very visible and hard to hide, so you want to be careful what you put on it. Aaron Carter basically screamed his feelings about love when he tattooed a very large word “Love” surrounded by flames on his neck. It seems like an angry tattoo and a little overkill. It was a three hour session that cost $500. Apparently, he has plans to tattoo as much of his body as he can. Carter has said that there is a big difference between him and Justin Bieber because he has endured hardship whereas Bieber has not. "Justin Bieber might talk about that, but bro, let me tell you, man," he said.</p><p><strong>"When you lose everything, and you’re in debt $5 million, and you have nobody wanting to believe in you, that's a phoenix rising from the ashes."</strong></p><p>So, why did he get such a large tattoo on his neck? "I’m always chasing after love," he declares. "And that’s why I got 'love' tattooed on my jugular, you know what I mean? I spent nine years trying to figure out how to file this bankruptcy so I can fix my career," he shares. "In the interim, I was working on music. And I spent nine years trying to figure it out."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kelly-osbourne-is-a-fan-of-one-word-tattoos><strong>Kelly Osbourne Is A Fan Of One-Word Tattoos</strong></h2><p>"Solidarity" is just one simple word that she has on her skull. On the other side of her head, it says, "Stories." She’s definitely a fan of one word tattoo designs. She got this tattoo after the horrific Orlando nightclub shooting. She has been a longtime LGBT supporter and that was what prompted her to ink “solidarity” on her head. She felt sad about the lives that were lost in the shooting and the pain it caused within the LGBT community. When she posted a picture on Instagram, she captioned,</p><p><strong>"Solidarity: 'Noun. Unity of feeling of individuals with a common interest or purpose.' Individually, we have rights and unique gifts. Together, we have strength and powerful harmony. I have wanted to get this tattoo for a long time. The tragedy in Orlando devastated me and reminded me that every moment of our lives is precious. Every human is precious."</strong></p><p>It’s an unusual tattoo style that will only be ever shown as long as she keeps her head shaved. She definitely has a strong belief system, we're just not sure she did the right thing by tattooing it on her head.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brad-pitt-s-scribbles-on-his-back><strong>Brad Pitt’s Scribbles On His Back</strong></h2><p>Brad Pitt really did allow Angelina Jolie to do whatever she wanted to him. Apparently, when they would be lying in bed, Angelina would draw on his back and Brad decided to turn that into a permanent tattoo. Some people may think that it’s sweet, but to us, it just looks like a bunch of random scribbles. It’s bizarre. What is he going to do with a tattoo like this now that the two have separated? Jolie told Entertainment Weekly that the tattoo was just a bunch of scribbles she made up.</p><p><strong>"We went to Davos and one night, we didn't have anything to do, so I was drawing on his back. He just liked it!"</strong></p><p>she says. "The picture everybody saw was kind of awkward, but it just lines up beautifully on his back, just enhances the part of the body I like. I mean, it's meaningful in that it's us making angles and shapes out of each other's body, that kind of a thing." Only a guy truly in love would even go along with something like this. We feel sorry for his next girlfriend who is going to have to look at that and think of Angelina.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ruby-rose-has-color-swatches><strong>Ruby Rose Has Color Swatches</strong></h2><p>You might think that this tattoo has a deeper meaning to it, but it really is just as random as Ruby Rose is. Most of her body is covered in tattoos and we have to assume that she just got bored one day. One of the tattoos that she has on her back is a bunch of color swatches. We wish that she had a good reason for tattooing it on her body, but she just doesn’t.</p><p><strong>"Guys, Home Depot is trying to save paper. So now you can order me and I will stand facing your wall until you pick the color you like,"</strong></p><p>she wrote on Instagram. "I'll even stand facing the wall as you have breakfast and as you're watching TV at night so you can see the colors at different times. Offer limited. Conditions apply. *This is a completely false ad." Could you imagine doing this to your own body as just a big joke? Only Ruby Rose could get away with doing something like this. “People said I’d never get work because I have too many tattoos,” she said in an interview with Elle magazine. “But I just finished arguably one of the biggest TV shows in the world right now.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ryan-cabrera-has-ryan-goslings-face-on-his-leg><strong>Ryan Cabrera Has Ryan Goslings Face On His Leg</strong></h2><p>Is he just a fan of the actor or is he actually a friend? Either way, we think it’s super weird that he has Ryan Gosling’s face on his body. "The best part is [the tattoo artist] did it portrait style, so it looks like the president in silhouette," the singer said in the Las Vegas Review-Journal.</p><p><strong>"I'm very proud of it. I consider it the Bentley of tattoos."</strong></p><p>He said that he ended up with the tattoo because he allowed a friend to pick out a tattoo for him. "We like to play a game called tattoo roulette," he said. "We blindfold each other: 'You get to pick a tattoo for me, and I get to pick a tattoo for you.' And you don't get to see it till they're both done." He might love the tattoo, but he has no intention of ever letting Gosling see it. Let’s be honest, it would be creepy. "No, no, no, I'm not showing it to Ryan," the singer said with a laugh. We don’t blame him one bit. Gosling would likely put out a restraining order on him.</p><p>References:&nbsp;<a href=#>oneindia.com,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>inkedmag.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>marieclaire.com,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>gq.com,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>usmagazine.com</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhqYGK%2BtrHSraCoppGXuaZ5wp6jnppdqa61wM6oqmavlWLEsMHLnWSnnaaav26vzqmwaA%3D%3D</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2f20-questionable-celeb-tattoos-we-would-never-copy.html&title=20%20Questionable%20Celeb%20Tattoos%20We%20Would%20Never%20Copy" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f20-questionable-celeb-tattoos-we-would-never-copy.html&description=20%20Questionable%20Celeb%20Tattoos%20We%20Would%20Never%20Copy" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f20-questionable-celeb-tattoos-we-would-never-copy.html&title=20%20Questionable%20Celeb%20Tattoos%20We%20Would%20Never%20Copy" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2f20-questionable-celeb-tattoos-we-would-never-copy.html&title=20%20Questionable%20Celeb%20Tattoos%20We%20Would%20Never%20Copy" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2f20-questionable-celeb-tattoos-we-would-never-copy.html&text=20%20Questionable%20Celeb%20Tattoos%20We%20Would%20Never%20Copy" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2f20-questionable-celeb-tattoos-we-would-never-copy.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Aldo Pusey</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-08-02</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./amaury-nolasco-net-worth.html><h3>&lt;&lt; Amaury Nolasco Net Worth | TheRichest</h3></a><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./today-show-halloween-costumes-2015-hosts-peanuts-characters-20153010.html><h3>Today Show Halloween Costumes 2015: Hosts Dress Up Peanuts Characters >></h3></a></div></div></section></section><div></div></div></div><footer class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h sk3-margin-v-full sk3-pad-v-full"><div class="sk3-pad-h txt-center-h">©
