The main source of this sum is his career as an actor, but Glover’s other activities have added to it as well. In the future this number might change, as Crispin continues working on many different projects.</p><h3>Crispin Glover Net Worth $3.5 Million</h3><p>Crispin Hellion Glover, or simply known as Crispin Glover, was born in 1964, in New York City. Both of his parents were actors so acting was not something new to Crispin. It’s no surprise that Crispin’s career as an actor began when he was only 13 years old. He first appeared in such shows as “Family Ties” and “Happy Days”. In 1983 Glover got the role in his first movie, which was called “My Tutor”. There he worked together with <a href=#>Matt Lattanzi</a>, Caren Kaye, Clark Brandon, Kevin McCarthy and many others. From that time Crispin Glover’s net worth started to grow. After his role in “My Tutor”, Crispin gained more attention from other producers and received more invitations to act in movies. One of his most famous roles is that of George McFly in “Back to the Future”. Other movies that Crispin has acted in include “Beowulf”, “Alice in Wonderland”, “Epic Movie”, “Mr. Nice” and others. All these appearances added to Glover’s net worth.</p><p>In addition to his acting career, Crispin has also involved in music. In 1989 he released an album entitled “The Big Problem Does Not Equal the Solution, The Solution Equals Let It Be”. What is more, he also recorded his own version of “Ben”, originally by <a href=#>Michael Jackson</a>. This also made Crispin Glover’s net worth higher. As mentioned before, Crispin also writes. It is said that he has written about 20 books. They include “Oak-Mot”, “The Backward Swing”, “Rat Catching” and others. Another activity which makes Crispin’s net worth grow is his work as a movie director. The first movie, that he directed was called “What Is It?”, which gained a lot of attention because it was really unusual. In 2007 his second movie was released, entitled “It Is Fine! Everything Is Fine”. This of course added to Crispin Glover’s net worth as well.</p><p>Finally, it can be said that Crispin Glover is a really talented and experienced actor, who has received a lot of acclaim because of his ability to portray weird and unusual characters. Undoubtedly, Crispin will act in many more movies and maybe will even create more movies of his own. In the future we will probably hear his name more often.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=26.336879432624><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Crispin Glover</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$3.5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>April 20, 1964</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>New York City, New York, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6 ft (1.85 m)</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Film director, Publisher, Author, Screenwriter, Music artist, Voice Actor</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Education</td><td>Beverly Hills High School (1982), Venice High School, The Mirman School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Betty Glover, Bruce Glover</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Michael Leigh</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Nicknames</td><td>Crispy , Crispin Hellion Glover</td></tr><tr readability=0.32558139534884><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/crispinglover</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.33333333333333><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.instagram.com/crispinhellionglover</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.34146341463415><td>MySpace</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.myspace.com/smileisdead</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000417</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.23880597014925><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.allmusic.com/artist/crispin-hellion-glover-mn0001338817</a></td></tr><tr readability=10><td>Awards</td><td>Jury Award - Best Narrative Film (2005), Fangoria Chainsaw Awards - Best Actor (2004, 3rd place), New Visions Award - Special Mention, Carnet Jove Jury Award ( Sitges - Catalonian International Film Festival, 2006, 2007)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Albums</td><td>The Big Problem ≠ The Solution.

Editing is a kind of, clean-up stage where the beauty comes into it.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>5</td><td>There's a tradition in the American media to ask actors what the movies are about, but it always seems wrong. It seems like the directors and the writers only often see an actor quoted in what a movie is about.</td></tr><tr readability=9.6466973886329><td>6</td><td>I think humor delineates who your friends really are. I worked on <a href=#>Little Noises</a> (1992) with <a href=#>Rik Mayall</a>, and he described to me a theory of humor. With pack animals, if there's a sick one in the bunch, the others will growl at it and try to get rid of it. This translates to the comedian on-stage. There are two types of comedians. One who says, "Everybody laugh at that person," and the braver comedian who makes them laugh or growl at himself. It brings people together. The audience laughs at this sick thing: they become a part of this clan or tribe. And that's where you get your friends: you share a certain humor about the sick and the foolish.</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>7</td><td>At a certain point in an actor's career it is good to say to oneself "What am I?" and then figure something out. You could call this entity an archetype as opposed to a stereotype. I believe this conclusion of self is a good thing to stick with, and explore the entire universe from this point of view. This does not limit one, but expand. It is only good if one can get some kind of truth from within this point of view. If it is a false ideal, then it will become a "stereotype" as opposed to an archetype.</td></tr><tr readability=8.2122905027933><td>8</td><td>Probably my four favorite directors are <a href=#>Werner Herzog</a>, <a href=#>Rainer Werner Fassbinder</a>, <a href=#>Stanley Kubrick</a> and <a href=#>Luis Buñuel</a>, because with all of their work you can think beyond the edges of the film. They're not films that dictate to you, this is what you must think. They're all films that have compelling stories, but there are thoughts beyond the films themselves.</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>9</td><td>I'm not somebody who believes that darkness is something that should necessarily be hidden from children or anything like that. I think children like a lot of the same things that they like as adults' or rather, the other way around, adults like a lot of the same things that they liked when they were children.</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>10</td><td>I do like things that are not necessarily a reflection of what is considered the right thing by this culture. Somehow, promoting that status quo I find uninteresting. I have thought about that more as the years have gone on, and it's a feeling that I would not have been able to describe 15 years ago as I can now. But at the same time, I don't intellectualize it, I don't have a written manifesto or just say this is the only thing I can do or will do.</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>11</td><td>I think what eccentricity can represent in terms of the fear it engenders is a challenge to what is already considered right or good by people who have invested a certain amount into their life and livelihood that is not eccentric, but centric. If there's a challenge to that, that can make people concerned that either what is considered a safe way of living or a good way of living may be pulled out from under them. I can understand that. That's why countercultural film movements are important since it's lacking in the culture right now. There's an idea that there's value to an alternate point of view, but everything that's presented in the media is procultural, and it makes people nervous when there hasn't been a true discussion of alternate points of view. There's no general discussion in the media.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>12</td><td>[on being called eccentric] Eccentric doesn't bother me. "Eccentric" being a poetic interpretation of a mathematical term meaning something that doesn't follow the lines--that's okay.</td></tr><tr readability=16><td>13</td><td>In the past, I've never tried to discount or stop what people are saying because on some levels I find it interesting. But if I look on the Internet or in news chat groups, I tend to read, "Oh, that guy's crazy, that guy's nuts. He's insane or psychotic." At a certain point, it does get a bit like, "I'm not. Really." Look, I one-hundred percent admit and in fact implore people to understand that, yes, I am very interested in countercultural things. But there's a difference between having artistic interests and being psychotic. That's more than a fine line of differentiation, and I do see that a bit too much.</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>14</td><td>[on absence of countercultural film] There's a healthiness to having something that people some people are taken aback by a little back, because what that means is that there's a discussion going on. And when there's nothing that's being taken aback, nobody's surprised, nobody's being tested or challenged, then there's no learning process going on, and it makes for a stupefied culture and I think that's happening.</td></tr><tr readability=11><td>15</td><td>The United States has its own propaganda, but it's very effective because people don't realize that it's propaganda. And it's subtle, but it's actually a much stronger propaganda machine than the Nazis had but it's funded in a different way. With the Nazis it was funded by the government, but in the United States, it's funded by corporations and corporations only want things to happen that will make people want to buy stuff. So whatever that is, then that is considered okay and good, but that doesn't necessarily mean it really serves people's thinking--it can stupefy and make not very good things happen.</td></tr><tr readability=10.626><td>16</td><td>[2002, in New York Press] Realism is always subjective in film. There's no such thing as cinema verite. The only true cinema verite would be what <a href=#>Andy Warhol</a> did with his film about the Empire State Building [<a href=#>Empire</a> (1964)]--eight hours or so from one angle, and even then it's not really cinema verite, because you aren't actually there.
